## Features

  - **YARA Rule Scanning**: Utilize YARA rules to detect known malware signatures in executable files.
  - **VirusTotal Integration**: Check files against the VirusTotal database for additional malware detection insights.
  - **Heuristic Checks**: Implement heuristic methods, such as file size analysis, to flag potentially malicious files.
  - **User-Friendly GUI**: Simple graphical user interface for easy file scanning and result display.
  - **Multi-Threading**: Perform scans in a separate thread to keep the GUI responsive.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `yara-python`
  - `requests`
  - `pefile`
  - `ssdeep`
  - `tkinter` (included with Python)
  - `pandas` (for data handling)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install yara-python requests pefile ssdeep pandas


##Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malware-detection-tool.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
      cd malware-detection-tool

3. Ensure you have the required packages installed (see the Requirements section).

4. Place your YARA rules file in the project directory and update the path in the script if necessary.

5. (Optional) Obtain a VirusTotal API key and replace the placeholder in the code.

Here's a sample README file for your malware detection tool that utilizes YARA rules, the VirusTotal database, and heuristic checks:

##Usage

    Run the application:

    ``bash
     python malware_detection_tool.py

    Click the "Browse" button to select an executable file (.exe) for scanning.

    The tool will perform:
        YARA rule scanning
        VirusTotal hash-checking
        Heuristic checks (such as file size)

    Once the scan is complete, results will be displayed in a message box.
